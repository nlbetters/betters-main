# Nicholas Betters â€“ Personal Projects

Welcome to my main GitHub repository! ðŸŽ‰  
This repo serves as the central hub for my personal projects, experiments, and learning journey in computer science, engineering, and beyond. Itâ€™s a mix of past school projects, independent builds, and explorations into areas I find interesting.
