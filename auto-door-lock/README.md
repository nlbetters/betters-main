# Auto Door Lock Project

## Overview
The idea behind this project came from solving an issue in my daily life.  
Many modern doors use key fob locks, but not all of them support remote access. This means you must have the physical key fob to lock or unlock the door, which can be inconvenient.  

The goal of this project is to address that limitation by creating a system that allows the lock to be controlled remotely, adding both **convenience** and **flexibility** without losing the security of the original design.
