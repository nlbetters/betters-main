# Bayesian Fourier Neural Operator (BFNO) Research Project

## Overview
This project was part of my **Summer Undergraduate Research Experience** at the **Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute (ROSEI)** at **Johns Hopkins University**, under the **Shields Uncertainty Research Group (SURG)**.  
This research explored how **Bayesian Fourier Neural Operators (BFNOs)** can be used to model uncertainty in neural network predictions, with potential applications in **energy forecasting**, **grid optimization**, and **sustainable systems modeling**.



## Motivation
Traditional neural networks are deterministic — they make one “best guess” without showing how confident that guess is.  
In fields like renewable energy, where data can be unpredictable, understanding **model uncertainty** is just as important as prediction accuracy.  
Our work combined **Bayesian inference** with **Fourier Neural Operators** to produce not just predictions, but a **distribution of outcomes**, providing better insight into model reliability.



## My Role
I worked on developing, testing, and analyzing Bayesian Fourier Neural Operator models to understand how uncertainty can be quantified in neural network predictions.  
This included running experiments to compare deterministic and Bayesian approaches, tuning hyperparameters, and studying how uncertainty affects model stability and reliability. I also explored how these methods could be applied to energy-related systems such as renewable forecasting and grid optimization.  

With the guidance of my graduate student mentor **Connor Krill**, I was introduced to **Python**, **PyTorch**, and **UQpy**, and learned how these frameworks connect in large-scale machine learning research — from model design and implementation to analysis and interpretation.  
I also wrote code for **BayesianConv3d**, now part of UQpy, which helps integrate Bayesian convolutional layers into uncertainty quantification workflows.  

Throughout the summer, Connor’s mentorship helped me connect the theory behind neural operators to real implementation and see how research ideas become working code.
